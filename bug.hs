This Haskell code attempts to use `foldl` with a function that modifies its accumulator in place.  `foldl`'s accumulator is passed by value (not by reference) in Haskell, so the modifications within the function are not reflected in the final result.

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

modifyList :: [Maybe Int] -> [Int]
modifyList xs = foldl modify [] xs
  where
    modify acc x = case x of
      Just y  -> y : acc
      Nothing -> acc
```
